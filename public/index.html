    <h1>Welcome to QRStats!</h1>
    <p>You can use this app to keep track of the number of visitors to your website.</p>
    <p>You give us a URL, and we generate an ID. You can then share a URL
        like https://qrstats.drewmca.dev/redirect/{ID},
        and when they visit the site, we'll write that down and redirect them to your URL.
    </p>
    <p>Then, you can visit https://qrstats.drewmca.dev/stats/{ID}, and see how many people have visited your site.</p>
    <p>Fill out the form below to setup your website!</p>
    <form action="/create" method="POST">
        <input type="text" name="url" placeholder="https://example.com" required>
        <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" optional>
        <p class="note">password is optional, but if you don't provide one, anyone can view the stats for the generated
            URL!</p>
        <input type="submit" value="Create">
