    <h1>Welcome to QRStats!</h1>
    <p>You can use this app to keep track of the number of visitors to your website.</p>
    <h2>Login</h2>
    <p>If you've already created an ID, login to view your <a href="/stats">/stats</a>.</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>You give us a URL, and we generate an ID. You can then share a URL
        that looks like <a href="/redirect/9aa7e609">https://qrstats.drewmca.dev/redirect/9aa7e609</a>,
        and when they visit the site, we'll write that down and redirect them to your URL.
    </p>
    <p>Then, you can visit <a href="/stats">https://qrstats.drewmca.dev/stats</a>, and see how many people have visited
        your site.</p>
    <h2>Create</h2>
    <p>Fill out the form below to setup your website!</p>
    <form action="/create" method="POST">
        <input type="text" name="url" placeholder="https://example.com" required>
        <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" optional>
        <span class="password-note">Password is optional, but if you don't provide one, anyone can view the stats for
            the
            generated
            URL!</span>
        <input type="submit" value="Create">
    </form>
    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>I can offer this app for free for now, but I can't promise it will always be available.
        If you find this tool to be useful, let me know!</p>
    <p>If you have any feedback, please <a href="https://github.com/drewmca/qrstats/issues">open an issue</a> or <a
            href="mailto:qrstats@drewmca.dev">email me</a>!</p>
