    <h1>Welcome to QRStats!</h1>
    <p>You can use this app to keep track of the number of visitors to your website.</p>
    <p>For example, if you wanted to track scans of a QR Code, for example.</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>You give us a URL, and we generate an ID. You can then share a URL
        that looks like <a href="/redirect/id">https://qrstats.drewmca.dev/redirect/id</a>,
        and when they visit the site, we'll write that down and redirect them to your URL.
    </p>
    <p>Then, you can visit <a href="/stats/id">https://qrstats.drewmca.dev/stats/id</a>, and see how many people have
        visited
        your site.</p>
    <h2>Get Started</h2>
    <p>You can get started by visiting <a href="/create">/create</a>.</p>
    <p>If you already have an ID, you can login to view your <a href="/stats">/stats</a> here.</p>
    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>I can offer this app for free for now, but I can't promise it will always be available.
        If you find this tool to be useful, let me know!</p>
    <p>If you have any feedback, please <a href="https://github.com/drewmcarthur/qrstats/issues">open an issue</a> or <a
            href="mailto:qrstats@drewmca.dev">email me</a>!</p>
